This is the first project I made with ReactJS following the tutorial.
I figured I could do few projects this way just to get familiar with the syntaxes and flow.

The idea of this project is to keep track of members of the company asigned to teams.
It works in a way where there is a list of groups with a list of employees in each group.

Choosing a group from select option shows you members of that group
and the card that represents a member will have black border.
Clicking on a member card without border will add this member to selected group
and clicking a card with black border will remove member from the 
selected team.
There is also navbar which navigates you to the home page and a list of 
groups with their members and their profession.

Hope it looks good and also that I will pick up on how to do this myself soon.
